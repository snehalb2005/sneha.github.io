        <h2>1. What are the kinds of problems we see in nature?</h2> 
            <ul> 
              <li><strong>Iteration:</strong> Solving problems through repeated steps (e.g., calculating compound interest, searching through an array).</li>
              <li><strong>Recursion:</strong> Solving a problem by dividing it into smaller subproblems (e.g., Tower of Hanoi, Fibonacci sequence).</li> 
              <li><strong>Backtracking:</strong> Exploring all possible solutions and discarding invalid ones (e.g., N-Queens problem, maze-solving).</li>
           </ul>
           <p>These approaches help solve real-world problems in physics, biology, and computer science.</p>

        <h2>2. What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important? Explain the different classes of problems and orders of growth</h2>
           <p>Space and time efficiency are critical measures of an algorithm's performance:</p> 
        <ul> 
           <li><strong>Space Efficiency:</strong> Refers to the memory an algorithm uses during execution. Efficient space usage is important for handling large datasets on devices with limited memory.</li> 
           <li><strong>Time Efficiency:</strong> Refers to the time an algorithm takes to complete. Faster algorithms are necessary for real-time applications.</li> 
       </ul> 
        <p>Algorithm complexity is measured using Big-O notation:</p> 
        <ul> 
           <li><strong>O(1):</strong> Constant time (fastest).</li>
           <li><strong>O(log n):</strong> Logarithmic growth.</li>
           <li><strong>O(n):</strong> Linear growth.</li>
           <li><strong>O(n²):</strong> Quadratic growth (slower).</li>
        </ul> 
      </div> 
    <div class="container">
      <h2>3. Take away from different design principles from chapter 2</h2>
      <p>Key design principles include:</p>
      <ul> 
          <li><strong>Divide and Conquer:</strong> Break problems into smaller, manageable subproblems (e.g., MergeSort, QuickSort).</li> 
          <li><strong>Greedy Algorithms:</strong> Make the best local choice at each step (e.g., Kruskal’s MST algorithm).</li> 
          <li><strong>Dynamic Programming:</strong> Store solutions to overlapping subproblems (e.g., Fibonacci numbers, longest common subsequence).</li> 
      </ul> 
      <p>These principles improve problem-solving efficiency and applicability to real-world scenarios.</p>

    <div class="container"> 
      <h2>4. The hierarchical data and how different tree data structures solve and optimize over the problem scenarios (tree, bst, avl, 2-3, red-black, heap, trie)</h2> 
      <p>Tree data structures organize hierarchical data efficiently. Examples include:</p>
      <ul>
           <li><strong>Binary Search Trees (BST):</strong> Efficient for searching and sorting.</li>
           <li><strong>AVL Trees:</strong> Self-balancing BST for maintaining logarithmic height.</li> 
           <li><strong>Red-Black Trees:</strong> Ensure balanced trees for faster insertions/deletions.</li> 
           <li><strong>Heaps:</strong> Used for priority queues.</li> 
           <li><strong>Tries:</strong> Efficient for prefix-based searching (e.g., autocomplete).</li>
      </ul> 
      <p>These structures optimize memory usage and reduce time complexity.</p> 
    </div> 
    <div class="container"> 
      <h2>5. The need for array query algorithms and their implications. Their applications and principles need to be discussed</h2>
      <p>Array query algorithms address problems like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Finding sums over ranges (e.g., prefix sums, segment trees).</li> 
        <li>Updating elements dynamically (e.g., Fenwick trees).</li> 
      </ul> 
      <p>Applications include real-time analytics, gaming, and financial systems.</p>

         <div class="container"> <h1>Algorithm Learning Reflections</h1> <h2>1. How do you determine the most efficient approach when solving a complex problem?</h2> <p>I start by examining the problem's constraints, considering the required performance, and evaluating possible trade-offs. I then assess whether approaches like divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, or greedy methods fit the problem’s needs.</p> <h2>2. How do you balance multiple conflicting constraints in a design?</h2> <p>My approach is to rank constraints based on their impact on the overall solution. For instance, I may prioritize minimizing time complexity in real-time systems while optimizing memory usage for resource-constrained environments.</p> <h2>3. What criteria do you use to evaluate the effectiveness of a solution?</h2> <p>Effectiveness is measured by factors such as correctness, efficiency, scalability, and simplicity. I also consider the algorithm’s ability to handle edge cases and robustness against invalid inputs.</p> <h2>4. How can you adapt an existing solution to address a new or unforeseen challenge?</h2> <p>By modularizing and generalizing parts of the algorithm, I can reapply them to new problems. For example, I could adapt Dijkstra's algorithm to handle negative edge weights by switching to the Bellman-Ford algorithm.</p> <h2>5. What strategies do you use to identify patterns or structures in datasets or problems?</h2> <p>I analyze the problem for repeating patterns, hierarchical relationships, or connections among data elements. This helps me select the most appropriate algorithm, such as dynamic programming or graph traversal techniques.</p> <h2>6. How do you decide when to prioritize simplicity over optimization in a solution?</h2> <p>I favor simplicity when the problem size is manageable or when optimization doesn't significantly improve performance. As systems grow larger, however, optimization becomes more important.</p> <h2>7. How does breaking down a problem into smaller components help solve it more effectively?</h2> <p>Dividing a problem into manageable components makes it easier to implement and debug. Techniques like divide-and-conquer take advantage of this approach to solve complex problems more efficiently.</p> <h2>8. What trade-offs do you consider when solving problems?</h2> <p>I weigh the trade-offs between time complexity, space usage, simplicity, and maintainability. For example, choosing a hash table for its O(1) access time might increase memory usage.</p> <h2>9. How do you identify and address potential limitations or weaknesses in a proposed solution?</h2> <p>I detect weaknesses through edge case testing, complexity analysis, and code reviews. To improve the solution, I either refine the existing approach or explore alternative methods.</p> <h2>10. How does applying knowledge from one context help solve a problem in another context?</h2> <p>Skills learned in one domain, such as dynamic programming in optimization problems, can be transferred to other areas like machine learning or game theory, providing effective solutions to real-world problems.</p> <h2>11. How do you decide when to innovate versus relying on tried-and-tested solutions?</h2> <p>When established solutions fulfill the problem’s requirements, I stick with them. However, if the challenge is unique or particularly complex, I consider innovation to find more efficient or novel solutions.</p> <button onclick="window.history.back();">Back</button> </div> </body> </html>
